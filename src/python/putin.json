Among the minority who do pay attention, most blindly believe whatever the talking points are from their chosen political party.  Our political class?  The guiding foreign policy philosophy for both parties is the neo con way.  Both Democrats and Republicans largely believe that America has a kind of &quot;manifest destiny&quot; to dominate the global political and economic sphere.  If the rest of humanity is holding out hope that the American people will somehow wake up or be moved to radically change the current makeup of the DC status quo, don&#39;t hold your breath.  Things will continue as they are up until a major economic collapse of our system.  How long will that be?  I don&#39;t know but things are gradually deteriorating here.  Our culture is post Christian and our economy is based on debt.  I would guess we will have a major collapse in the next ten years, possible less.  I pray God will help us all as we live in evil days.",
